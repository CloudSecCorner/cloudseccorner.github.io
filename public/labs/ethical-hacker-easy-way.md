## Ethical Hacker Easy Way 

1. Know the OS 

# Operating system 

in simple words an operating system is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware it helps us communicate and work with computers 

you probably might hvae worked with operating systems like Windows or MacOS 

but as hacker you might have to bid goodbye to these and get hands on with operating system called linux 


# Kali Linux 

Linux is one of the most powerful operating systems as a matter of fact m mobile OS -
Android is powered by linux 

linux has varioys open source distributions such as Ubuntu , Red hat , Backtrack , kali etc , We will be using kali linux as  our choice of OS to learn hacking 

Kali is an operating ststem designed by hcakers for hackers and somethhing that you might work with regularly in your learning journey 

# Introduction to kali linux 

kali linux is a Debian derived Linux distribution designed for digital dorensics and penetration testing . it is maintained and funced by Offesive Security 
lets understand what it is and why you should choose kali linux


# Install 

there are two way to use kali linux 

1. either boot a system with kali and have a dedicated system 

2. or Virtually install kali in your Windows or Mac system 


we will prefer the second way and to do this we will need a softwaee called Virtual bix in which we will virtually install kali linux 


Once the virtul box is downloaded simply browse the offical website of kali linux and download it 

Have you ever workded with kali linux before ? 

if yes then this journey will be quite easy for you 
if no don't worry you will master soon enough 

# overview 

since we have installed kali linux and you probably will be using it throghtout your hacking career in order to make you comfortable leys have a basic overview of this operating system 

linux commands you should know

- pwd - it prints the current working directory 
- ls - This command is used to list information or content in a particular file/folder 
- cd - it is used to change current working directory 
- mkdir - create a new folder 
- man - displays the help manual for a particular command 
- shutdown - shutdown or restart your system 
- rmdir - used to remove/delete a directory/folder 
- clear - Clear the terminal 
- apt-get update - update kali linux 
- apt-get-install - to install a new program 


## Networking Commands 

networking is one of the important concepts when it comes to hacking . few network related commands that will be really handy when you work with network to gather information and much more 

- ifconfig - it is similar to the windows command ipconfig it shows basic networking details such as IP addressed , broadcast address , mac address and much more 

- iwconfig - it is similar to the ifconfig command it is more focussed on only wirelass network interfaces 

- ping - it is usually used as a simple way to verify that a computer can can communicate over the network with another computer or network device 

- arp - it used to find IP of MAC address mapping ARP which stands for address Resoulation Protocol is a protocol used to map a MAC address (or hardware address) to an IP address. 

- netstat - it delivers basic statistics on all network activities and informas users on which prots and addeessed the corresponding connections (TCP,UDP ) are running and which ports are open for tasks 

- route - it fetches the routing table it basically tells whre all the network is actually routed 

## Scripting in kali 

we will be doing is building an IP sweeper script basically we will write a script that will ping all the IP addressed in the given range and filter out the IPs that responded and save it in text file 

later we can use this to perform various operation on the at IP addresses 


commands that we will use 

- grep - it is used to search given file for patterns specified by the user . Basically `grep` lets you enter a pattern of text and then it searches for this pattern within the text that you provide it 

- tr - the tr command is used for translating or deleting charchaters 

- cat - cat command allows us to create single or multiple files the view containing the file , concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files 

- cut - it is used to extact esctions from each line of input - usually from a file 

- echo - it is used to print anything on the console 


if else in bash 

allow us to make some decision based on some conditions 

```
#!bin/sh 
a= 0 
b =20 
if [$a==$b]
then 
echo "a is equal to b"
else 
echo "a is not equal to b"
fi"

```

for loops 

the for loop operates on lists of items . it repeats a set of commands for every item in the list . it used to itrate over something above is the syntax of for loop 

```
for var in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
do 
  echo $var 
done 
```

the script 

below is the IP sweeper script 
```
#!/bin/bash 
for ip in `seq 1 254`; do 
ping -c 1$1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d "" -f 4 | tr -d ":"" & 
done 
```

breaking down 


```
#!/bin/bash 
``
its basically a comment we are telling computer that it is a bash script 

```
for ip in `seq 1 254`; do 

``
this is for loop . we want to execute the command for every ip in the given network range 

this we write a for loop execute it in a range for 1-254 that is , the number of ip addressed in a particular network 

```
ping -c 1$1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d "" -f 4 | tr -d ":" & 

```

we known that of the ip is active it will respond the demo if responding will be something like this `64 bytes from given_ip where given ip will be the ip pinged too 

thus from the whole response now we will need only  the ip address if the responded ip 

`cut -d "" -f 4 : this command basically does the same thing it cuts the whole response with the delimater -d where whitespace (" ") and picks the 4th term(-f 4)
form it that will be the ip . 

## Breaking Down 

the cut coommand will basically produce output like 192.68.1.1 

tr -f ":" : hete we pass colon(;) as a delimiter and tr command deletes it 

& : this basically allows the thread to work simulatanously 

| (pipe) : it basically joins all the above command as single command 

`./ipsweep.sh [fisrt three range of your ip]` 


# Hack The MAC 

- MAC Spoofing 

- MAC addtess stands for media access control address 
- MAC address ensures that the physical address of the computer is unique 
- MAC Spoofing is a technique for changing a factory assigned Media Access Control (MAC) addtess of a network interface on a network device 

it just like taking over someone else's identity and perfoming actions by impersonating them 

MAC Spoofing plays a major role when it comes to network hacking . MAC spoofing helps you overtake the identity of some other device in the network and plays a major role in one of the most dangerous attacks called Man in the middle . 

MAC ? 

are you familar with what is MAC address is ? 

as you might known , The MAC address ( Media Access Control Address ) ensures that the phycial address of the computer is unique . 

- What is MAC Address ? 

When it comes to networking , the MAC address is something you sureky might have heard of . it stands for Media Access Control 

it is a permanent , physical and unique address assigned network interfaces by the manufacturer 

so whatever it is a wirelass card or a wired ethernetc ard each of these cards comes ip with addressed that are unique to themeselves 

- MAC address 

as we know an IP address is used on the internat to identify computers and communicate between the devices 

similarly the MAC address is used withing the network to identify devices and transfer data between devices . 

Thus each piece of data or a packet that is sent within the network contains a source MAC and a destination MAC 

therefore this packet would flow from the source MAC to the destination MAC 


- How  to check ? 

Run the command "ipconfig/all" to check the MAC address of various network cards on your Windows system 

Run the 'ifconfig' to check the MAC address of various network card on your kali linux system 

linux - `ifconfig`
windows - `ipcongif/all`


- WHY ? 

Since this is a physical unique address to each interface to each network device and because it is used to identify devices then changing it will make you 
anonymous on the network 

Not only that but the MAC address is often used by filters to prevent or allow devices to connect to networks and do specific tasks on the network 

so we being able to change your MAC address to another device's MAC address will allow you to impersonate this device and allow you yod o thing sthat you 
might not be able to do 

so you woild ne able to bypass filters or connect to networks that only specific device with specific MAC addressed can connect to you will also be able to 
hide your identify interesting right ? 

- Legitimate Reason for hacking the MAC 

an example of the legitamate use of MAC Spoofing is changing the function  of a single computer from a router to a computer and back to the router through MAC spoofing 

if you only have a single public IP , you can only hook up one unit directly (PC or Router)


if one has two WAN IPs , the MAC address of the two devices must be different . 

for whatever reason if one need to swap 2PC's regularly to connect the canle modem it would be a lot easier to change the MAC address rather than to change the Network Interface Card (NIC)

- Non-Legitimate Reason for Hacking the MAC 

An example of an illegitamate use it when an attacker change the MAC address of his station to enter a target network as an authorized to function on the network . 

with this new identity an attacker can wreak havoc for example to launch Deniel of Service attacks or bypassing access control mechanism to advance more intrusion 

An attack might choose to change one's MAC address in an attempt to evade network intrusion detection system , to became invisible to security measures allowing more time to act without detection 


## Time for practical 

you now know what a MAC address is and its related concepts 

it is time for some practical implementation and actually performing MAC spoofing 

Get your kali ready open up terminal and lets start ... 

below are  the steps that will help us change the MAC address 

- Disable the interface you want to change the MAC address for 
- Change the MAC address 
- Enable the interface 

simple right ? Now lets see how its done  

## In action 

Run the command ifconfig 

check the interface you want to change the MAC for lets say it is the interface eth0 

In the response returned by the ifconfig command look for the "ether". this will contain the corresponding MAC address 

> Remember - Once we change the MAC address it doesn't stay forever once you restart the system the original MAC automatically replaces the spoofed one 

Follow the step and run the given commands 

1) Disable the interface - `ifconfig eth0 down`

- Here eth0 is the name of the interface we want to change the MAC for . 

2) Change the MAC address - `ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55 

- Here `hw' stands for hardware interface and `00:11:22:33:44:55` is the fake MAC that we have given to change the MAC . The MAC address will be changed to given random address 

3) Enable the interface : `ifconfig eth0 up` 

Now simply run the command ifconfig the check! the MAC address wil changed .. 


Lets do it on Windows Now 

change MAC on kali was really interesting and simple leys check how it can be done on windows for this we will use tool call Technitium MAC address Changer 

it is a freeware utility to spoof the MAC address instantly 

1) Download and install Technitium 
2) Execute the file 
3) Go to the network connection tab in Technitium 
4) Select wifi 
5) Select Random MAC address option 
6) click on change Now 

simply go to the windows command line and run the command `ipconfig/all` 

Notic the change in the MAC address 

lets you can go to Technitium and restore the orignal one again 


# preventing MAC Spoofing 

Knowing the skills is great but it is also necessart to know how to prevent it . lets check that out  

MAC spoofing can be a big probelm on shared segment networks However the current generation of Ethernet switches are offering us a basic for defeating this kind 
of instrusion by offering us MAC locking 

MAC locking 

its is possible to lock MAC address to specific physical port on the switch 

When MAC-locking locks a MAC/Port combination , it prevents the MAC address from being used from any other port on the segement 

This combined with Static ARP and MAC/IP filters could totally eradicate the spoofing possiblities on shared-segment network 

Exoensive , Managed switches allow port locking but the disadvantage is the overhead cost 

## Using ARP tables 

the use of the (static) ARP table in combination with the routing table could prevent of the shared segment spoofing possiblities 

Most operating system by default do not check if a received IP datagram originated from local MAC address matches the MAC addresses in the static ARP table or 
if the external datagram matches the MAC address of one of the kmown network routers that have a avlid route entry in the routing table 

Unauthorized MAC addresses are therefore exposed and the decision to take defesive action can then take place 


## Real life facts 

- MAC address is not an attack that give you access to system but it will play a very important role in networking hacking 
- MAC Spoofing is one of the important steps in wifi hacking 
- Heard of something called MITM(MAN in The Middle ) Attacks? MAC spoofing plays a very important role there as well 
- You can change your MAC to the MAC of another system and pretend to be someone else thus you can sit in middle of the network and intercept it 


## Gathering Information 

Generally , there are five steps in Hacking the one needs to follwo there are 

- Footprinting or Information Gathering 
- Scanning 
- Gaining Access 
- Maintaining Access 
- Cleaing Tracks 

footprinnting is the first and very important step where we collect infromation about the target/victim 


## Introductin to Footprinting 

- footprinting is the initial stage of any hacking activity where we are try to gather some basic information about the target . Footprinting helps us in deciding path we have to follow during our hacking activity  


## Information gathering 

Footpring is the method of gathering necessary information about the targte , target computer systen or a network to execute a cyber attack 

Footprinting is also knowm as reconnaissance . Some of the information that we weed to scrap in this method are 

- Domain name 
- IP Addresses 
- Phone Numbers 
- Email 

# Why ? 


why is information gathering done ? 

imagine a scenario where you went hunting in a forest 

how do we decide which weapon will need and what preparartions we have to do before actually searching for a hunt ? 

we look for footprints of animals that gibe us an idea which animal went from here and in which direction it went 

based on these footprints we decide our plan if it is a tiger we need to prepare in different ways and if its a deer then plan will be different than that of the
tiger 

Similarly in the case of hacking footprinting give is an idea about the target 

we try to gather as much information about the target as possible 

lets us say we went to hack a website the footprinting will help us gather basic information about that website 

we will look which technology that website uses if oys PHP website the plan will be different , while if it is an ASAP website the approach will be different  

so using footprint we can decide what tools will we need and what techniques can be used to hack the target  

if you do not perform footprinting then we will end up firing bullets in the dark  

# some online tools 

you know what footprinting is and why it is done 

you also know the importance of it its time to dive deep and see some pratical implementation 

here are some online tools that might help to gather information abiout target  

- Archive.org - sometimes you need to scrape data from websites of your target . Archive.org is used to gather information from the old version or the closed website of your target  

it is like an internate time machine the sites are cloned onto the different servers and you can access it to gather data by just entering the domain  

- Who.is - it is used to search the who.is database lookup domain and IP owner information and check out dozens of other statics 

you can get all the data you need about a domain and everything associated with that domain anytime with single search  

- pipl.com  - its is one of the most useful online information gathering tools 

it will give all information about a person that is present on their various social media sites or the data that has been leaked . the information will be sufficient enough to know a person's stregth weakness , location and other such details 

- Insecam.org - All the cameras connected to the internet are available and we can access them it is the worlds biggest directory of online surveilance security cameras 

select a country to watch live street , tarffic , parking office , road beach earth online webcams now you can search for live webcams around the world 

- Exploit-db.com - it is used to see IoT devices , usernames , passwords , etc and other available information 

Even it contains  varioys scripts and tools that might have been used in some real hacks  

- OnlineEmailTracer - EmailTracer is a tool to track the email senders identity  . it analyzes the email header and gives the complete details of the sender IP address , which is a a key point to find the culprint and the route followed by the mail , the mail server . details of the service provider etc EmailTracer up to the internet service provider level only 

Further tracing can be dome withe help of ISP and law enforcement agencies the message id will be useful for analyzing mail logs at ISP 

## Use Kali Linux to gather information 

Namp and Zenmap 

NMAP and ZenMAP are useful tool for the sacnnning phase of Ethical Hacking in kali linux . NMAP and ZenMAP are parctically the same tool however NMAP uses the 
command line while ZenMAP has a GUI  

NMAP is free utility tool for network discovery and security auditing  

Many systems and network administratos also find useful for task such as network inventory , managing service upgrade schedules and monitoring host or service uptime 


## Detecting the OS 

lets detect OS type/version of the target host the parameter OS type/version detection is variable '-O' for useful check our NMAP Lab 

the command that we will use is 

```
nmap -O 192.168.1.101 
```

here the ip address mentioned should be the IP address of the target 

checking the open ports 

Now we will find all the Open TCP and UDP ports to scan all the TCP ports based on NMAP use the following command  

```
nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 192.168.1.101
```

where the parameter "-p" indicates all the TCP ports that habe to be scanned in this case we are scanning all the ports "-T4" is the speed of scanning at which 
NMAP has to run 

## NMAP stelth Scan 

A Stealth scan or SYN is also known as a half open scan as it doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake handshake  

A hacker sends an SYN packet to the target if  an SYN/ACK frame is recieved back then it assumed that the taregt would complete the connection and the port is listing 

if an RST is received back from  the target then it is assumed that the port isn't active or is closed 

use the parameter -sS in NMAP following is the full command -

```
nmap -sS -T4 192.168.1.101 

```

DNS Tools 


Dnsenum.pl - 

the first tool is dnsenum.pl which PERL script that helps to get MX , A and other records connected to a domain . 

type "dnenum domain name" and all the records will be shown 

Dnsmap 

the second tool is DNSMAP which helps to find the phone numbers , contacts and other subdomains connected to this domain that we are searching for 

```
dnsmap domain name 
```

## Real life facts 

- we know information gathering plays an important role when it comes to Hacking 
- Using these tools you can gather enough information about your target wheather it is a person or a system 
- The information gathered is enough to create a plan of action for the attack
